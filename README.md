`wolfenstein_lite` is a demo I made after getting inspired by Wolfenstein 3D's rendering technique. I referred to [this](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) cool guide whenever I got stuck.

The technique (ray-casting) allowed Wolfenstein to render a 3D world multiple times per second on insanely limited hardware. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOCQfxRQ2pY) video for an overall idea about the technique and learn about a few interesting optimizations.

While the original devs (including the legendary John Carmack) optimized the hell out of W3D's code, same can't be said of my code. I focused on making things work.

## Running

1. Ensure you've `cargo` setup properly. `cargo` is Rust's package manager. It can be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Do `cargo run --release` in the project's root directory.
3. This will kick-off the demo. Code will be compiled the first time you run that command. It will take some time.

## Random Note

It really sucks that GitHub flavored markdown doesn't allow embedding videos. Videos look way better than lifeless screenshots in this particular case.
